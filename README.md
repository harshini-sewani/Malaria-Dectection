# Malaria-Dectection
Abstract:
Malaria has been a challenge in the tropical and subtropical countries and therefore it is necessary to take necessary steps to detect and control the disease. The existing methods such as microscopy require a lot of expertise. Convolution Neural Network has been proposed in order to detect and classify the single image as either infected or uninfected. 
By applying fully trained CNN using keras achieved 94% accuracy. Also we have applied ResNet-50 model which is pretrain model.

Steps to run:
There are ipynb files and py file too. When you want to run py file you need to remove first two lines of code and make sure to download dataset from https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932
which is zip file named as cell_images.
